# 3D Point Cloud Visualizer

This tool provides a simple yet powerful way to visualize and analyze 3D point cloud data.

## Features

- Load `.ply` files and visualize them in a 3D space.
- Apply voxel downsampling to simplify point clouds.
- Calculate and display various statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation, and point density.
- Compute geometric properties including the centroid and volume of the bounding box.
- Interactive GUI for easy manipulation and analysis.

## Installation

To set up the 3D Point Cloud Visualizer, you will need Python and Open3D library.


pip install open3d matplotlib tkinter


## Usage

Run the application from the command line:


python point_cloud_visualizer.py


In the GUI:

1. Click `Open PLY File` to load your point cloud data.
2. Select options for downsampling and color mapping as needed.
3. Choose the statistical and geometric properties you wish to calculate.
4. View the results and visualizations immediately.
